# Project Description
### Overview
This project is a REST API backend system, designed to handle messaging between users. It was developed using the Django framework, adhering closely to professional coding standards to ensure maintainability and efficiency.

### Features
- **User Messaging:** Allows sending and receiving messages, with features to handle message ownership, retrieval of all messages for a user, filtering unread messages, reading a specific message, and deletion capabilities.
- **Authentication:** Implements an authentication method to ensure users can only access their messages.
- **Database Integration:** Utilizes PostgreSQL for robust data management and storage.
- **Testing:** Includes comprehensive unit tests for serializers, models, and views to guarantee code reliability and quality.
- **Documentation:** Provides a downloadable Postman collection to facilitate API testing and interaction.

### Deployment
The API is hosted on a Heroku server, ensuring high availability and easy access:

- Heroku Server URL: [Server URL](https://messaging-system-0a4a6d9ca7d4.herokuapp.com/)

- You can access the admin dashboard and make requests with Basic Auth using:
- **Username:** `yaacov`
- **Password:** `mypassword`

### Postman Collection
A Postman collection has been prepared to demonstrate the API's capabilities and ease the testing process. It is available for download via the following GitHub link:
